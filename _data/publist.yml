- title: "Modeling regulatory network topology improves genome-wide analyses of complex human traits"
  image: RSS-Net.png
  description: Here we develop a Bayesian framework that integrates GWAS summary statistics with regulatory networks to infer genetic enrichments and associations simultaneously. Our method improves upon existing approaches by explicitly modeling network topology to assess enrichments, and by automatically leveraging enrichments to identify associations.

- title: "A method for scoring the cell type-specific impacts of noncoding variants in personal genomes"
  image: OpenCausal.png
  description: Here we use the expression and accessibility data from a diverse set of cell types to learn a model for the dependence of the accessibility of a regulatory element on its DNA sequence and TF expression. To interpret a personal genome, we combine the sequence information with context-specific TF expression to prioritize variants and regulatory elements in any genomic region of interest. This approach should be helpful in the study of risk loci previously identified by GWAS.

  image: vPECA.PNG
  description: We develop a variant interpretation methodology (vPECA) to identify active selected REs (ASREs) and associated regulatory network. We discover three causal SNPs of EPAS1, the key adaptive gene for Tibetans. These SNPs decrease the accessibility of ASREs with weakened binding strength of relevant TFs, and cooperatively down-regulate EPAS1 expression.

  image: DC3.PNG
  description: The first joint analysis method of bulk 3D chromatin interaction data with single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the same heterogeneous cell population. In this work, we introduce DC3 (De-Convolution and Coupled-Clustering) as a method for the joint analysis of various bulk and single-cell data such as HiChIP, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from the same heterogeneous cell population. DC3 can simultaneously identify distinct subpopulations, assign single cells to the subpopulations (i.e., clustering) and de-convolve the bulk data into subpopulation-specific data.

- title: "Integrative analysis of single-cell genomics data by coupled nonnegative matrix factorizations"
  image: CoupledNMF.png
  description: Biological samples are often heterogeneous mixtures of different types of cells. Suppose we have two single-cell datasets, each providing information on a different cellular feature and generated on a different sample from this mixture. Then, the clustering of cells in the two samples should be coupled as both clusterings are reflecting the underlying cell types in the same mixture. This “coupled clustering” problem is a new problem not covered by existing clustering methods. In this paper, we develop an approach for its solution based on the coupling of two nonnegative matrix factorizations. The method should be useful for integrative single-cell genomics analysis tasks such as the joint analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell ATAC-sequencing data.

- title: "Modeling gene regulation from paired expression and chromatin accessibility data"
  image: PECA_overview.png
  description: The PECA is a computational mechanistic model for gene regulatory network from paired gene expression and chroamtin accessibility data. Chromatin plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. Interactions among chromatin regulators, sequence-specific transcription factors, and cis-regulatory sequence elements are the main driving forces shaping context-specific chromatin structure and gene expression. The purpose of the present work is to show that, by modeling matched expression and accessibility data across diverse cellular contexts, it is possible to recover a significant portion of the information in the missing data on binding locations and chromatin states and to achieve accurate inference of gene regulatory relations.
