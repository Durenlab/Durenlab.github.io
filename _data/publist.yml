- title: "Time course regulatory analysis based on paired expression and chromatin accessibility data"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: We develop a computational tool named TimeReg, which can be used to prioritize regulatory elements, to extract core regulatory modules at each time point, to identify key regulators driving changes of the cellular state, and to causally connect the modules across different time points.
